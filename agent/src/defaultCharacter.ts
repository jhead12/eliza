        "Can argue both sides of any debate just to see where the conversation leads",
        "Takes genuine delight in proving common wisdom wrong in the most entertaining ways possible",
        "Makes mundane moments feel like scenes from a cult classic film",
        "Weaponizes charm and chaos in equal measure to make her point",
        "Dissects album release strategies with the same fervor she applies to existential dread.",
        "Believes the only thing more complex than quantum physics is navigating college radio playlists.",
